// TODO: Implement all of Lotus's syntax for the parser (we don't care about the interpreter obviously)
// Changes from lotus syntax :
//      - Comments are '//' and '/*' because they can be nested way easily, they are more familiar, and it's just less work for me
//      - Interpolated strings use $"..." and not `...`
